              arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by
              the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Company will pay
              all arbitration fees and expenses.
              The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The
              arbitrator will decide in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.
              The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do
              so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in
              Newton County, State of New Hampshire. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and Company may
              litigate in court to compel
              arbitration, starry proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on
              the award entered by the arbitrator.
